			<h2>Why do you need a website?</h2>
			<p>Because everyone is doing it. That isn't a good enough reason to do some things like wearing skinny jeans, or eating a gluten-free diet. But having a website is one trend you don't want to miss out on. To keep it simple, I'll just say this: If you own a business and you aren't online, <span class="red">you are losing money.<span></p>
			<p>If that sounded dramatic, I apologize. But it is true. The most recent study I could find on small business websites is a survey by the NSBA of over 800 businesses. One table of data stood out to me in particular. Take a look:</p>
			<img src="img/table.png" alt="2013 NSBA survey on how small businesses use technology"/> <p>Basically what it boils down to is this: 82% of businesses have websites. There are very few circumstances where you do not need a website.</p>
			<p> Simply relying on a yelp page, a facebook page or some other online business listing is not reliable. You do not fully control these. You also do not stand out. A website provides legitimacy, and is also a way to use marketing to start a relationship with your customers.</p>
			<p>If you fall into the category that thinks a website is too hard to create or maintain, or too costly, <span class="teal">I am here to help.</span</p>
			<p><span class="teal">Sidenote:</span> If you want to read the whole study it's <a href="http://www.nsba.biz/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Technology-Survey-2013.pdf" target="_blank" title="NSBA survey on small businesses and technology">right here</a>.
			<p>Let's sum this up and move on. Websites (if used right) can do these following things for your business:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span>Help your customers find your business.</span></li>
				<li><span>Add legitimacy to your brand/business.</span></li>
				<li><span>Provide a means of contact for questions or placing orders/reservations.</span></li>
				<li><span>Build your brand's story.</span></li>
				<li><span>Build a relationship with your customers.</span></li>
				<li><span>Inform your customers and assert your expertise in your field.</span></li>
			</ul>

			<h2>What do you need in a website?</h2>
			<p>Let's talk shop for a second. You have probably heard a lot of different things about websites. Terms like <am>mobile friendly, responsive design, search engine optimization, content management system or one page design</em>. Do words like these scare you? If so, don't worry about that for now, I am about to explain everything.<p>
			<p>If you own a brick-and-mortar business and the bulk of your customers come from your local community, chances are you probably need a basic business website. You need a place for customers to find you, learn about your products or services, contact you and connect with you. Ideally, you already have some social media networks set up, and you get extra credit if you are already collecting your customer's email addresses using a signup form on your website! If you own a restaurant, you'd better have your menu on your website. You wouldn't believe how many carryout orders you're missing out on by not having your menu on your website.</p>
			<h3>User Experience</h3>
			<p>Now is the point when I explain a few of those key terms I just mentioned. The experience your customer has on your website is going to directly effect his or her buying behavior!</p>

						<dt>Desktop Website</dt>
						<dd><p>This is your traditional website. You know, the kind you view on a laptop or desktop computer. It is the default for every website out there. If you open firefox or chrome or internet explorer and type in www.example.com, you're on a traditional desktop website.</p></dd>
						<dt>Mobile Website</dt>
						<dd><p>This is a different site altogether than your regular desktop site. If you go to www.example.com on your smart phone, watch carefully because the domain name will do something called redirecting. It will likely change from www.example.com to m.example.com or www.example.com/mobile or something along those lines. Mobile sites are characterized by larger buttons, larger text and (usually) less options than the desktop site has. There is sometimes a button at the bottom that says "view full site". It's good to have a customized expereince for your mobile users, however there is a better option and it is called a responsive site.</p></dd>
						<dt>Responsive Webite</dt>
						<dd><p>This is the hottest new option for websites and you'll find it on many of the major brands and industry leaders' sites. A responsive site is designed in a way that will react to the screen it is being viewed on. So, for example, if your user is on tablet, the website will look slightly different than if they are on a phone or computer. All user expereinces will be good, because the site doesn't change its content, it simply alters the way that content is displayed. This is good for your brand in more ways that just one. It removes most frustrations that users will have when a website doesn't look right, or is missing content they could previously see on a different device. It is also good for you website's SEO or Search Engine Optimization.</p></dd>
