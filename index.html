				<h3>Mobile UI Design</h3>
				<p>Dave has plenty of experience designing for mobile devices. He understands the importance of cross-browser compatibility with an emphasis on screen size. Take this website for example. Yes, the very one you are looking at right now! It is a responsive site designed on a 12-column grid. It uses media queries to adjust to different device's pixel aspect ratios.</p>

				<h3>Advanced HTML & CSS</h3>
				<p>Dave has solid foundations in HTML & CSS as well as a strong grasp of responsive design and designing on a grid. What Dave lacks in formal education, he more than makes up for in drive and hard work. Dave is constantly taking online classes to learn new design trends and keep up with the ever-changing technology. Dave has over six years of experience coding in HTML & CSS.</p>

				<h3>jQuery</h3>
				<p>You want things on your screen to move? Easing, elegant fading and simple JQuery animation techniques are some things that really make Dave's websites pop. Great design is understated and subtle. Most end users can't describe it, but they know it when they see it. Dave puts the finishing touches on his projects with JQuery to make his projects go from good to great.</p>

				<h3>php</h3>
				<p>A great front end developer should be well rounded and know at least a bit about some of the server-side languages like php, ASP.NET and Ruby. Dave has focused most of his backend time learning php. He has used it to develop dozens of custom Wordpress sites, as well as a couple of basic standalone applications. He is not yet an expert in php, but it's safe to say he has a solid working knowledge.</p>

				<h3>Photoshop</h3>
				<p>One of the great bonuses that Dave has to offer is his extensive knowledge of Photoshop, and his eye for design. Before he dedicated the majority of his time to becoming a code monkey, he worked as a graphic designer and artist. He has designed multiple bilboards, newspaper and magazine ads and digital banner ads.  Whether you need a quick mockup, or full print-ready art, Dave is your guy. </p>

			<h3>I Want A Job I Love.</h3>
			<p>This is the most important goal I have right now. I am not someone who easily settles. Life is short and I believe we only get one shot at this thing so I am going to make the most of it. I have a lot to contribute to a forward-thinking, leading-edge company. I work well on my own and as part of a team and I always meet deadlines. I am open to working from anywhere but my first choices would be places like Denver, Boulder, Austin, San Francisco, Palo Alto, or Nashville. I'm basically looking for somewhere where I can</p>
